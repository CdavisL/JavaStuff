Differences Between Git and GitHub

    GitHub allows you to store your Git respositories, where you store your timeline SC
    It gives you server space to store your repositories remotely
        You can interact with this on your local machine using push/pull
        It allows you to add collaborators for team projects

The Actual Differences
    Git is SC software, gives you the backbone of SC
    GitHub allows you to add more functionality to Git
        It builds off Git and gives platform to use Git
            GitHub is more user friendly

BOTH GIT AND GITHUB CONTAIN A SPECIAL TERMINAL ON THE WEB TO INTERACT WITH REPOSITORY

So there are many terminals out there:
    Git.bash
    PowerShell
    Win Prompt (windows + r, cmd.exe)
        You can also go to Program Features and opt in to use Linux style terminal

    Commands To Know
        ls
        mkdir folders
        ls folders
        cd folders
        /folders

        may need $ for cmd

THE BEST TERMINAL IS BASH BECAUSE ITS WIDELY USED

About Terminal

A terminal is a way to interact with your OS directly
    you can interact with OS just by opening folder and trolling through it 
    this interaction is built off the terminal 

        the goal of an OS like Windows 10 is to make a user friendly exp, hiding the terminal's complexity

        there's a lot of things you can do in the terminal that you can't do in DUI (direct user interface?)

        a shell and a terminal are almost the exact same thing

Windows CMD vs Ubuntu

In CMD, you are in the c/drive
In Ubuntu, it's more of a sub system
    when you started Ubuntu the first time, it created a subsystem for Linux

    CASE AND SPACE SENSITIVE!!!

        *type sudo in first!
        * try cd .. in Ubuntu

Shells have different cmds from each other
    UBUNTU CMDs
        cd .. (change directories) (you can type in the path if you know it already)
        cd mnt/ (move directories)
        ls (list)
        mkdir folderName (creates new folder)
        cd ~ (return to original directory)

    SHORTCUTS
        type part of filename and then tab (autocompletes)
        cd .. takes you back a level

File Structure

In terminal, use cmds to cd .. and mnt/ directories, this specifies the file path (where file is located on computer);
    you can make a new folder with mkdir
