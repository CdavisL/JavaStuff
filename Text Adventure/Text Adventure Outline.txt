Project lets create a text rpg using html/css/javascript

        Choices can be activated using and saved using alert, confirm, and prompt
    with console.log acting as save state

        Dot notation can be used as feature to get users to interact with the story and jump around the page

        Light artwork, childish in nature

        If, else choices, with failure ending in "Rocks fall, everyone dies." No matter what the situation
